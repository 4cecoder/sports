# Fastbreak Event Dashboard - Progress Tracker

## Challenge Overview
Build a full-stack Sports Event Management application where users can create, view, and manage sports events with venue information.

**Time Expectation:** 2-3 hours

---

## Technical Requirements

### Framework & Tools
- [x] Next.js 15+ (App Router)
- [x] TypeScript
- [x] Supabase (Database)
- [x] Tailwind CSS
- [x] Shadcn UI Components
- [ ] Vercel Deployment
- [x] Supabase Auth (Email)
- [ ] Google OAuth Sign-in

---

## Core Requirements

### Authentication
- [x] Sign up with email & password
- [x] Login with email & password
- [ ] Google OAuth Sign-in
- [x] Protected routes (redirect to login if not authenticated)
- [x] Logout functionality

### Dashboard
When users login, they should be taken to a home page / dashboard that:
- [x] Displays list of all sports events
- [x] Shows key event details: name, date, venue, sport type
- [x] Navigate to create/edit event forms
- [x] Responsive grid/list layout
- [x] Search by name - refetches from the database
- [x] Filter by sport - refetches from the database

### Event Management
User should be able to create events:

## Additional Requirements

### Server-Side Data Management
- [x] All database interactions happen server-side
- [x] Server Actions (preferred over API routes)
- [x] NO direct Supabase client calls from client components
- [x] Generic action helpers for type safety and error handling

### UI/UX Requirements
- [x] Use shadcn/ui components throughout
- [x] Forms use shadcn Form component with react-hook-form
- [x] Consistent styling with Tailwind CSS
- [x] Loading states throughout application
- [x] Error handling
- [x] Toast notifications for success/error states

### Code Quality
- [x] TypeScript strict mode
- [x] ESLint configuration
- [x] Proper error boundaries
- [x] Type-safe database schema with Drizzle ORM

---

## Submission Requirements

- [ ] Deployed to Vercel with working public URL
- [x] Code submitted via GitHub repository
  - Repository: https://github.com/4cecoder/sports

---

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema
Using Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL via Supabase:

**Events Table:**
- id (uuid, primary key)
- name (varchar)
- sportType (varchar)
- date (timestamp)
- description (text, optional)
- userId (text, foreign key to auth)
- createdAt, updatedAt (timestamps)

**Venues Table:**
- id (uuid, primary key)
- name (varchar)
- address (text, optional)
- city (varchar, optional)
- state (varchar, optional)
- country (varchar, optional)
- eventId (uuid, foreign key to events)
- createdAt, updatedAt (timestamps)

### Server Actions Implemented
Located in `lib/actions/event-actions.ts`:
- `createEvent()` - Create new event with venues
- `getEvents()` - Fetch events with search/filter
- `getEventById()` - Fetch single event
- `updateEvent()` - Update existing event
- `deleteEvent()` - Delete event (cascades to venues)
- `getSportTypes()` - Get unique sport types for filters

All actions use the `createAuthenticatedAction()` helper for:
- ✅ Type safety with Zod validation
- ✅ Consistent error handling
- ✅ Authentication verification
- ✅ Return type standardization

### UI Components Created
- `EventCard` - Display event with hover effects and actions
- `EventFormDialog` - Create/edit event form with venue management
- `DeleteEventDialog` - Confirmation dialog for event deletion
- `DashboardClient` - Main dashboard with search/filter
- Enhanced landing page with hero and features

### Styling Enhancements
- Modern blue/green gradient color scheme
- Hover glow effects on cards
- Sticky header with backdrop blur
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Professional empty states
- Responsive design throughout

## Remaining Tasks

### High Priority
1. [ ] Set up Google OAuth in Supabase dashboard
2. [ ] Add Google OAuth sign-in button to auth pages
3. [x] Add loading states to dashboard and forms
4. [ ] Deploy to Vercel
5. [ ] Test deployed application thoroughly

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Add skeleton loaders for better perceived performance
- [ ] Add optimistic UI updates
- [ ] Add venue location autocomplete
- [ ] Add event date validation (no past dates)
- [ ] Add pagination for large event lists

## Progress Summary

**Completed:** 27/29 core requirements (93%)
**Remaining:** 2 items (Google OAuth, Vercel Deployment)

**Estimated Time to Complete:** 15-20 minutes
